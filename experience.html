            The main source of my experience has been derived from the classroom along with the time I take outside of class to elevate my learning. I have been seeking
            an internship or other employment more aligned with my career goals this past year. My time as an AI Exploration Guide has been fun and educational. I love learning
            about new advencements made in AI. What I really desire now is the oppurtunity to tie together all of my soft skills to create something fun and innovative.
