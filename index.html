    My name is <strong>Katherine Freeman.</strong> I am 22 years old obtaining my BS in computer
    science from Ithaca College. I am an aspiring mobile developer. I embarked on my journey at Ithaca studying exercise science with a minor
    in computer science, but soon switched the two around. I quickly fell in love with writing scripts and making
    my code come to life, so I made computer science my major and never looked back. My love for exercise has never dithered;
    in fact one of the first team projects I worked on, <a href="projects.html">LiftOff</a>, is an app that combined my two interests by creating
    a fun user experience with tracking your weights during a workout. My goal is to independently get LiftOff on the Apple AppStore. 
    While I would love to be in mobile development, I have developed full-stack and web development
    skills from my time in college. I am also extremely curious about all things AI. I encourage you to explore my other <a href="projects.html">projects</a> 
    and <a href="experience.html">experience</a>. Happy hunting.
